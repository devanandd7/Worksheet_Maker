MAIN QUESTION
           Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Strategy: On-Page Technical Implementation and Off-Page Backlink Generation for Digital Portfolios                                       
                 >>a.>> Analyze and implement essential On-Page SEO elements within the source code of the website (https://asecfolio.vercel.app/), including meta title, meta descriptions, canonical tags, and image alt-attributes to improve indexability and keyword relevance.               
                 >>b.>> Conduct a comprehensive SEO audit of the target website before and after the implementation of optimization techniques, providing detailed metrics on crawlability, site health, and visibility scores.               
                 >>c.>> Execute an Off-Page SEO strategy by generating high-quality backlinks through social media integration, specifically focusing on LinkedIn sharing to enhance domain authority and referral traffic.               
AIM
●	To evaluate the baseline SEO performance of a React/Vercel-hosted web application using automated auditing tools.
●	To implement critical meta tags (Description, OpenGraph, Twitter Cards) to enhance social sharing and search snippet quality.
●	To improve accessibility and SEO through systematic image alt-text implementation and semantic HTML structure.
●	To understand the mechanism of backlink generation through high-authority social platforms like LinkedIn.
●	To measure the quantifiable impact of technical SEO changes through comparative reporting.
Strategic Search Engine Optimization Implementation
The primary aim of this lab experiment is to master the dual pillars of Search Engine Optimization—On-Page and Off-Page strategies—applied to a real-world web application (https://asecfolio.vercel.app/). This practical exercise involves auditing the existing technical structure of the website, identifying SEO gaps in the source code, and systematically applying meta-level optimizations to align with search engine ranking factors. Furthermore, the practical explores the impact of social signals and backlink building in the context of Off-Page SEO to boost the site's credibility and search presence.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
In the competitive digital landscape, a website's visibility is determined by how effectively search engine crawlers (like Googlebot) can interpret its content. The initial state of the portfolio website, >>https://asecfolio.vercel.app/>>, lacks the necessary metadata and semantic structure required for high-ranking search results. Without descriptive meta tags, search engines struggle to generate relevant snippets, leading to a low Click-Through Rate (CTR). Furthermore, the absence of an Off-Page strategy means the site lacks 'Domain Authority,' as there are no external signals or backlinks validating its content.
The core challenge involves: (1) Technical remediation of the source code to include SEO-friendly tags without breaking the existing UI/UX, (2) Bridging the gap between a low initial SEO score and a target professional score (90+), and (3) Initiating a backlinking campaign through professional networks to establish social proof and drive referral traffic, thereby demonstrating the holistic cycle of web analytics and optimization.
