i think i you take this approuch , as user upload system it working , and as i admin i also that account to use as user , so my approuch is , when as admin upload sample pdf and header than it will be uploaded on cloudinary , so to analyse the pdf and tempalate id , pass the url of uploaded sample pdf to  user upload sample page logic where ai analyse it and auto save it and generate tamplate id is store it and set with default tempalate id with repected college/university name , cu have cu tamplate id , du have own tamplete id. like that. other waise make own analyse of  featue for admin  ? what you prefer , you go with existing funtionlity or create new.
